```{r template-setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# load the case study library
library(modelAnalyzeR)
library(dplyr)

# all data will be loaded in the parent document and referenced within each of the child sections
```

### The Method (put title of method here)
How it works in detail. Parameters experimented with and what they do.

```{r model-test-variable}
# head(logs)
```

#### Results
Evaluate best performance (tuned parameters) against the criteria defined in the main document for each of the time periods.

**TO DO** Tables go here
One per AS/TS/Exec

#### ROC Curve
Graph all points on the graph as lines per AS/TS/Exec and as an overall line

#### Alogrithm Complexity  


#### Conclusions
Observations noticed on the results. Strengths/Weaknesses of the model. Any patterns?
